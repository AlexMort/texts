####Little is known regarding the long-term effects of caloric restriction (CR) on the risk for atherosclerosis. We evaluated the effect of CR on risk factors for atherosclerosis in individuals who are restricting food intake to slow aging.We studied 18 individuals who had been on CR for an average of 6 years and 18 age-matched healthy individuals on typical American diets. We measured serum lipids and lipoproteins, fasting plasma glucose and insulin, blood pressure(BP),high-sensitivityC-reactiveprotein(CRP),platelet-derived growthfactorAB(PDGF-AB),bodycomposition,andcarotidartery intima–media thickness (IMT). The CR group were leaner than the comparison group (body mass index, 19.6 +- 1.9 vs. 25.9 +- 3.2 kg/m2; percent body fat, 8.7 +- 7% vs. 24 +- 8%). Serum total cholesterol (Tchol), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, ratio of Tcholtohigh-densitylipoproteincholesterol(HDL-C),triglycerides, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, CRP, PDFG-AB, and systolic and diastolic BP were all markedly lower, whereas HDL-C was higher, in the CR than in the American diet group. Medical records indicated that the CR group had serum lipid–lipoprotein and BP levels in the usual range for individuals on typical American diets, and similar to those of the comparison group, before they began CR. Carotid artery IMT was ~ 40% less in the CR group than in the comparison group. Based on a range of risk factors, it appears that long-term CR has a powerful protective effect against atherosclerosis. This interpretation is supported by the ﬁnding of a low carotid artery IMT. 


Atherosclerotic arterial  disease  is the leading cause of mor- bidity  and  mortality  in  Western   societies  and  is rapidly increasing  in  the  developing  nations  (1).  During  the  Second World  War  the  shortage   of  food  in  some  North   European countries  led to a sharp  fall in mortality  from coronar y arter y disease;  when the  war ended  mortality  rose  sharply  (2).  Data obtained on the eight subjects confined to Biosphere 2 for 2 years showed that caloric restriction  (CR)  with a low-protein  diet can improve  a number  of risk factors  for atherosclerosis, including blood  pressure  (BP),  serum  total  cholesterol (Tchol),  and  tri- glyceride (TG) levels (3, 4). However, no information regarding the long-term effects of CR in humans eating a good quality diet
is available.

CR has been  shown to slow aging in rats, mice, fish, worms, and various insects (5). There  are a small number  of individuals who have been practicing CR for a number of years in the belief that  CR will also extend  their  lifespan beyond the usual range. The availability of these  individuals is making it possible for us to  investigate  the  effects  of long-term  CR  in humans.  In  this study we measured a range of risk factors for atherosclerosis and carotid arter y intima–media thickness (IMT)  in individuals who have been practicing CR for periods ranging from 3 to 15 years. In  addition,  we present  serum  lipid and  lipoprotein data  that some of the study participants obtained  through  their  personal physicians before  and during  the period  of CR.

###Methods

#####Study  Participants. 

Eighteen  individuals  who are  practicing  CR were recruited through  the  Caloric  Restriction Optimal  Nutrition Society. Three  were from the St. Louis area and the others came to the Washington  University Medical Center  from other cities in the  U.S. and  Canada.  Their  average  age was 50 +- 10 years (range 35– 82 years). Three of the 18 are women. They were in good health,  with no chronic  diseases.  None  were smokers. Eighteen  individuals eating a usual American diet, matched with the  CR group  in terms  of age and  socioeconomic  status,  were used  as a comparison  group.  None  of the  participants in this study were taking lipid-lowering, antihypertensive, or other medications  that could affect the variables that were measured. They were enrolled  in this study after  giving written  informed consent and undergoing a physical examination, medical histor y, and  laborator y evaluation   that  revealed   no  evidence  of  any health problems. All of the study participants were weight stable, i.e., less than  2 kg of weight change in the preceding  6 months. Twelve of the individuals on CR provided us with copies of their medical records, which included BP and serum lipid and lipopro- tein concentrations, obtained by their personal physicians before and  during  the  period  of CR.  This study was approved  by the Human  Studies Committee of Washington  University School of Medicine.

#####Anthropometrics and  Body Composition. 

Height was measured without  shoes to the nearest  0.1 cm. Body weight was obtained on a balance  scale in the morning after a 12-hr fast. Body mass index (BMI)  was calculated  by dividing body weight  (in  kilo- grams) by the square  of height (in meters).  Total body fat mass and lean mass were determined by dual-energy  x-ray absorpti- ometr y (DEXA) (QDR 1000/w, Hologic,  Waltham,  MA),  as described  by Salamone  et al. (6).

#####Blood Analyses. 

A venous blood sample was taken  to determine lipid and hormone concentrations after  subjects had fasted  for at least 12 hr. Measurement of serum lipid and lipoprotein concentrations  was  performed  in  the   Core   Laborator y  for Clinical Studies at Washington  University. Cholesterol and glycerol-blanked  TG  were  measured by automated enzymatic commercial   kits  (Miles/Technicon,   Tarrytown,  NY).   High- density   lipoprotein  cholesterol  (HDL-C)  was  measured  in plasma after precipitation of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins by dextran  sulfate  (50,000  molecular  weight)  and magnesium  (7).  Low-density  lipoprotein  cholesterol (LDL-C) was  calculated   by using  the  Friedewald   equation  (8).  These methods  are continuously  standardized by the Lipid Standard- ization  Program  of the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Pre- vention.  Plasma  glucose was measured by the  glucose oxidase method  (Beckman  Instruments, Fullerton, CA), and insulin was measured by R IA (9). C-reactive  protein  (CRP)  was measured by  using  a  high-sensitivity  ELISA  kit  (A LPCO  Diagnostics, Windham,  NH).  Platelet-derived growth  factor  A B was measured  with an ELISA  kit (R & D Systems, Minneapolis).

#####BP. 

BP was measured with a mercur y sphygmomanometer, with the patient  in the sitting position  after  5 min of rest in a quiet environment, according  to the recommendations of the Amer- ican Hypertension Society. Four  measurements of systolic and diastolic BP were made  at ~5-min inter vals and averaged.

#####Ultrasonographic Measurement of  Carotid   Intima–Media  Thickness (IMT). 

B-mode ultrasonographic imaging of the common carotid arter y was performed by using high-resolution real-time  ultra- sonography  with an 11-MHz transducer. The examinations  and image analyses were performed by a trained  sonographer who remained unaware  of  other  data.  In  brief,  the  right  and  left carotid  arteries  were scanned  for measurement of IMT  in the longitudinal  projections over an  arterial  segment  including  30 mm of the distal common carotid arter y (10). IMT was measured in the anterior wall of the vessel as the distance from the trailing edge of the adventitia  to the leading edge of the intima–media, and  in the  posterior wall of the  vessel it was measured as the distance  from  the  leading  edge  of  the  intima–media  to  the trailing edge of the adventitia.  The average of 16 measurements was taken  as the mean  IMT.

#####Dietary   Assessment.

All of the  volunteers  were  instructed  by a research  dietitian  to record  for 7 consecutive  days all food and beverages consumed, preparation methods, and approximate portion sizes in food diaries at the time of consumption. To assist with portion  size determinations, measuring  spoon and cup sets were provided to all participants, and all food diaries had a ruler imprinted on the back cover. The food record  was analyzed  by using the NDS-R program (version 4.03 31), which is the Nutrition Data   System  for  Research  from  the  Nutrition  Coordinating Center  at the  University  of Minnesota. The  database  has 117 nutrients.  The  nutrients of interest  are  calories,  total  fat, total carbohydrate, total  protein,  animal  protein,  vegetable  protein, saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsatu- rated  fatty acids, sucrose,  starch,  soluble  fiber, insoluble  fiber, folate,  vitamin B12, all of the different  fatty acids (4:0 to 22:6), all of the amino  acids, phytic acid, and trans fatty acids (11).

#####Statistical Analysis.

For  normally  distributed variables  with approximately  equal  standard deviations  the  unpaired Student  t test  was used.  For  variables  not  normally  distributed, or  with unequal standard deviations, the Wilcoxon two-samples test was used. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05 for all tests. All data were analyzed by using SPSS FOR  WINDOWS software, version 10.0 (SPSS, Chicago). All values are expressed as means +- SD.

###Results

#####Body Weight  and  Composition.

BMI was significantly lower in the CR group than in the comparison  group (Table  1). BMI, based on body weight records kept by the participants, decreased from
24 +- 3 (range 29.6 to 19.4) kg/m2 to 19.5 +- 2 (range 22.8 to 16.5) kg/m2  during  the  period  of CR,  which averaged  6 +- 3 years (range  3 to 15 years), with nearly all of the decrease  occurring during the first year. The BMI values for the individuals in the comparison  group  were similar to the  mean  range  for middle- aged  people  in  the  U.S.  (12).  Total  body  fat  and  trunk  fat, measured by dual-energy  x-ray absorptiometr y, were extremely low in  the  CR  men  (Table  1).  Average  values  for  the  three women in the CR group were 19.8 kg/m2 for BMI and 18.8% for total body fat, and for the three women in the comparison  groupthe average  values were 26 kg/m2  for BMI and 31.9% for total body fat.

#####Risk  Factors   for   Atherosclerosis.  

The   serum   Tchol,  LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG concentrations of the comparison  group (Table2) fall close to the 50th percentile value for people  in their age group  in the U.S. (ref. 13, accessed Sept. 20, 2003 at www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/cholesterol/atp3xsum.pdf). The compari- son group’s BP and fasting plasma glucose levels (Table 2) were also similar to the average values found in middle-aged  healthy people in the U.S. (14, 15). In contrast,  the average serum Tchol and  LDL-C  concentrations of the  CR  group  fall in the  lowest
10% for people  in their  age group  (13) (Table  2). Even  more unusual  are the CR group’s TG levels, which are similar to the 5th-percentile values for 20-year-olds (13) (Table 2). Unlike the decrease   in  HDL-C   that   often  occurs  when  individuals  are placed  on low-fat diets to lose weight, the  CR group  had  high HDL-C  levels, in the 85th to 90th percentile range  for middle- aged  men  in the  U.S. (13) (Table  2). As a consequence, their Tchol/HDL-C ratio is remarkably low. Twelve of the individuals in  the  CR  group  gave  us  records   of  their  serum  lipid  and lipoprotein levels  obtained   through  their  personal   physicians before  starting,  and  during,  the  CR.  As shown in Table  3, the average serum Tchol, LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG levels of the CR group  before  they began  CR were close to the  50th percentile levels for  middle-aged   persons  in the  U.S.  (13).  Most  of the decrease  in body weight and  improvement in serum  lipid and lipoprotein levels occurred  during the first year of CR (Table 3). Both  systolic and  diastolic  blood  pressures  in the  CR  group were remarkably  low, with values in the range found in 10-year- olds (16) (Table 2). As shown in Table 3, the initial BP levels of the 12 individuals in the CR group who gave us copies of their medical records were similar to those of the comparison  group. Large decreases  in systolic and diastolic BP occurred  during the first year of CR with a further  decrease  to extremely low levels occurring  during  the  subsequent period.  Surprisingly,  none  of the individuals in the CR group had symptoms of postural hypotension.  Fasting  plasma  insulin  concentration  was  65% lower and fasting plasma glucose concentration was also signif- icantly lower in the CR than in the comparison  group (Table 2). The  plasma  CRP  concentrations of the  individuals  in the  CR group   are  extremely  low  (Table   2).  The  average   value  for high-sensitivity CRP  in the CR group  was only 16% as high as that  of the  comparison  group.  Serum  platelet-derived growth factor A B concentration was also much lower in the CR than in the  comparison   group  (8,567 +- 2,642 pg  ml  in  the  CR  and 17,727 +- 4,926 pg/ml in the comparison  group; P = 0.0001).

#####Carotid  IMT. 

IMT of the common  carotid  arter y was ~40% less in the CR than in the comparison  group (0.5 +- 0.1 mm in the CR and 0.8 +- 0.1 mm in the comparison  group; P = 0.0001). None of the individuals on CR had evidence of atherosclerotic plaque, defined  as an IMT of more  than  1.0 mm and an increase  of at least 100% compared to an adjacent  wall segment  (17).

#####Nutrient Intake. 

Nutrient intakes  differed  significantly between the diet groups. The CR subjects designed their diets to consume a balance  of foods that  supply more  than  100% of the Recom- mended  Daily Intake  (RDI) for all of the  essential  nutrients, while minimizing  energy content  (1,112–1,958 kcal/day). They eat a wide variety of vegetables, fruits, nuts, dair y products,  egg whites, wheat and soy proteins, and meat (~26% of calories from protein, ~28%  from  fat,  and ~46%  from  complex  carbohy- drates).  All of CR group strictly avoid processed  foods contain- ing trans fatty acids and high glycemic foods (e.g., refined carbohydrates, desserts,  snacks, and soft drinks).  The compari- son  group  ate  typical  U.S.  diets  containing   nearly  twice  as many calories as the CR subjects (1,976–3,537 kcal/day; ~18% calories from protein, ~32% from fat, and ~50% from carbohydrates).
A wide range  of supplements were  taken  by both  CR  and comparison  subjects, ranging from one multivitamin  per day to combinations of  antioxidants,   vitamins,  selenium,  and  folate (Table  4). Four  CR  and  three  comparison  subjects  were  not taking any supplements. Serum lipid, lipoprotein, and CRP concentrations, BP and IMT of subjects not taking supplements were not statistically significantly different  from those who were taking supplements (data  not shown). Serum concentrations of several  antioxidants,  including  vitamin  E and  b-carotene, and minerals, including selenium and magnesium, measured in 10 of the 18 CR subjects, were in the normal  range  (Table  5).

#####Discussion

Little   is  known  regarding   the   effects  of  long-term   CR   on metabolic  health  in nonobese humans.  In this study, we evalu- ated the metabolic  profile of 18 men and women who had been on  self-imposed  CR  for  3–15 years.  Our  data  show that  CR results in profound  and sustained beneficial effects on the major atherosclerosis risk factors, serum Tchol, LDL-C, HDL-C,  TG, and BP, that  usually increase  with advancing age. They further show  that  CR  provides  a  powerful  protective   effect  against obesity  and   insulin  resistance,   and   provide   evidence   for  a decrease  in inflammation, as ref lected  in extremely  low CRP levels.
To our knowledge,  the only other  information regarding  the effects of CR in nonobese people was that obtained  on the eight individuals sealed inside Biosphere  2 for 2 years. As a result of technical  problems,  food  availability  was reduced  and  caloric intake  averaged    ~1,780 kcal/day during the first 6 months  (3). Like the CR individuals  in the present  study, the Biospherians underwent large  reductions  in Tchol,  LDL-C,  and  BP  (3, 4). However, in contrast  to the increase  in HDL-C  that occurred  in our CR group, the Biospherians had a large decrease  in HDL-C (3, 4), presumably  because  of differences  in composition  of the diets. The Biospherians’  largely vegetarian  diet was ver y low in fat (~10% of energy intake) and high in carbohydrate (~76% of energy intake),  with protein  supplying ~14% of energy intake. It is well documented that  energy-restricted high-carbohydrate diets  result  in a decrease  in HDL-C  (18). In contrast,  the  CR group  in the present  study restricted their  carbohydrate intake to, on average,  46% of energy intake.
Studies  of the  effects of CR  in rhesus  monkeys  have shown reductions  in fasting plasma glucose and insulin (19 –21) but not in serum Tchol (22). The individuals on CR in the present  study also  had  low  normal   fasting  plasma  glucose  concentrations despite remarkably  low fasting plasma insulin levels. The differ- ence in serum cholesterol responses  between humans  and mon- keys is probably explained by the monkeys’ low initial cholesterol
level.
Of  the  risk factors  documented by epidemiological studies, elevated  serum cholesterol has the distinction  that it can induce development  of  atherosclerosis  in  the  absence  of  other   risk factors.  This is evident  in people  with familial hypercholester- olemia (23) and has been demonstrated repeatedly in studies on animals (24). Furthermore, lowering cholesterol levels has been shown to reduce cardiovascular  disease mortality (25). However, factors  other  than  Tchol,  such  as HDL-C  (26),  BP  (27),  and inf lammation,  as  ref lected  in  CRP   (28),  are  also  of  major importance, as evidenced by the marked  variability in the development  of  clinical  atherosclerotic  disease  in  individuals with similar cholesterol levels.

A large percentage of both CR and comparison  subjects were taking  a  variety  of  supplements.  However,   this  should   not interfere with the interpretation of our findings, because  it has been  shown  that  supplementation  with  antioxidant  vitamins does not lower serum lipid and lipoproteins (29 –34) or BP (29). Moreover,   a  recent   study,  conducted  in  more   than   20,000 subjects, found that vitamin E, vitamin C, and  b-carotene supplementation resulted  in small  but  significant  increases  in plasma  Tchol,  LDL-C,  and  TG  concentrations  (30).  In  the present  study we found no significant differences  in serum lipid, lipoprotein, and CRP concentrations, BP, or IMT between supplemented and not-supplemented subjects.
In addition  to the roles of the lipoprotein fractions  to which cholesterol is bound, i.e., decreased risk with high HDL-C levels, and increased risk with high LDL-C levels, and BP, it has become evident  that  inflammation  plays a major role in atherosclerosis (25, 35). Atherosclerotic plaque  formation appears  to be medi- ated  by a chronic  inf lammator y process resulting  from interactions  between  macrophages, oxidized  cholesterol, and  cellular components of the arterial  wall (35). A key component of this process is the proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells and deposition  of extracellular  matrix. This proliferative  effect appears to be mediated by high levels of insulin and other growth factors, including platelet-derived growth factor  (36).
 
In studies of the slowing of aging by CR in rats and mice, it was found  that  CR results  in a marked  decreases  in cellular  proliferation  and  inflammation  (37–39). The  present  finding  of extremely  low CRP  levels in the  CR group  provides  preliminar y evidence that CR also reduces inf lammation  in humans. CRP is a marker  for inf lammation  (40) and may also play a role in the inf lammator y process  (41, 42). This may explain why CRP  is a strong  predictor of  cardiovascular   events  such  as  myocardial infarction  (28). The present  findings of ver y low plasma insulin and serum platelet-derived growth factor levels in the CR group provide preliminar y evidence that CR also results in a decreased stimulus for cell proliferation in humans. Platelet-derived growth factor  is a  potent   chemoattractant and  mitogen  for  vascular smooth muscle cells, and some drugs that counteract its biological actions  have been  developed  for the  treatment of athero- sclerosis (43, 44).
In conclusion,  the results of this study on 18 individuals who had  been  on  severe,  self-imposed  CR  for  3–15 years  provide evidence that CR is highly effective in lowering the risk of developing  atherosclerosis.

After all how good it is to be in America! Despite waiting in line at a passport control in Miami for 2 hours. I was almost dead. I had to lie on the floor right there. I got enough sleep, walked by the ocean, ate some pizza in a trade center and everything is OK again. 

Now i'm sitting around at the computer, no worries. Enjoying the sun and a small breeze. Tomorrow is a conference day.

Though my problems haven't vanished, I'm not worried about them. In Moscow i'm all nerves. Maybe it's the cold and a lack of vitamin D. 

In America I feel like i'm in a movie. You watch series all the year round and then bang, you buy tickets and here you are - just in the middle of a film. The only downside is that the fate of humankind bothers less. The thing that bothers me is whether sunglasses suit me.

There are many pregnant women around. It would be strange if there were not, given such weather.
